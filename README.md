# PetCity
ReactNative App
Project Structure:

App Navigation Structure:

You'll need a navigation system to handle moving between screens. You can use react-navigation or @react-navigation for this purpose.
Screens:

RegistrationScreen.js: This screen will contain the sign-up and login forms.
HomeScreen.js: The home screen where the pet store information and map will be displayed.
Firebase Integration:

Set up Firebase in your project and configure authentication.
Create Firebase authentication functions to handle user sign-up and login.
Google Maps Integration:

Set up Google Maps API integration in your project.
Create a MapView component on the HomeScreen to display the map.
Use the Google Maps API to place markers for pet stores on the map.
Directions API Integration:

Integrate the Google Directions API to provide directions from the user's current location to the selected pet store.
Logic:

RegistrationScreen.js:

Create a form with fields for user registration (e.g., name, email, password).
Implement the sign-up logic using Firebase authentication.
Provide an option for users to log in if they already have an account.
HomeScreen.js:

Display pet store information, such as shop name and phone number.
Implement the map view with markers for different pet stores.
Allow users to select a store and see directions from their current location.
Project Files:

Here's a simplified folder structure for your project:


myPetStoreApp/
  |- src/
     |- navigation/
        |- AppNavigator.js
     |- screens/
        |- RegistrationScreen.js
        |- HomeScreen.js
     |- components/
        |- MapView.js
     |- utils/
        |- firebase.js
     |- App.js
  |- package.json
Note: This is a high-level structure, and you may need to add additional files and folders as you develop the app.
