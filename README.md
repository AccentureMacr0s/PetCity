# PetCity
[ReactNative App](https://chat.openai.com/share/f3d3d95d-3b6c-419f-ae21-3eb89f056baa)
Project Structure:

App Navigation Structure:

You'll need a navigation system to handle moving between screens. You can use react-navigation or @react-navigation for this purpose.
Screens:

RegistrationScreen.js: This screen will contain the sign-up and login forms.
HomeScreen.js: The home screen where the pet store information and map will be displayed.
Firebase Integration:

Set up Firebase in your project and configure authentication.
Create Firebase authentication functions to handle user sign-up and login.
Google Maps Integration:

Set up Google Maps API integration in your project.
Create a MapView component on the HomeScreen to display the map.
Use the Google Maps API to place markers for pet stores on the map.
Directions API Integration:

Integrate the Google Directions API to provide directions from the user's current location to the selected pet store.
Logic:

RegistrationScreen.js:

Create a form with fields for user registration (e.g., name, email, password).
Implement the sign-up logic using Firebase authentication.
Provide an option for users to log in if they already have an account.
HomeScreen.js:

Display pet store information, such as shop name and phone number.
Implement the map view with markers for different pet stores.
Allow users to select a store and see directions from their current location.
Project Files:

Here's a simplified folder structure for your project:


myPetStoreApp/
  |- src/
     |- navigation/
        |- AppNavigator.js
     |- screens/
        |- RegistrationScreen.js
        |- HomeScreen.js
     |- components/
        |- MapView.js
     |- utils/
        |- firebase.js
     |- App.js
  |- package.json
Note: This is a high-level structure, and you may need to add additional files and folders as you develop the app.



Configuring Firebase and adding a Google Maps API key are essential steps to ensure that your app's authentication and mapping features work as intended. Here's a brief overview of what you need to do:

Firebase Configuration:

Create a Firebase Project: If you haven't already, go to the Firebase Console and create a new Firebase project. Follow the prompts to set up your project.

Add Your App to Firebase: In the Firebase Console, add your app to the project. Firebase will provide you with configuration details, including a Firebase SDK configuration snippet.

Configure Firebase in Your App: In your Expo project, create a firebase.js file in the utils folder. Import Firebase and initialize it with the provided configuration.

javascript
Copy code
// utils/firebase.js
import firebase from 'firebase/app';
import 'firebase/auth'; // Import any Firebase services you plan to use

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  authDomain: 'YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN',
  projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
  storageBucket: 'YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET',
  messagingSenderId: 'YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID',
  appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
};

firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

export default firebase;
Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY', 'YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN', and other values with the actual values from your Firebase project settings.

Implement Authentication: Use Firebase's authentication methods to implement user registration and login logic in your RegistrationScreen.js. You'll need to import Firebase from your firebase.js file.

Google Maps API Key:

Get a Google Maps API Key:

Go to the Google Cloud Console.
Create a new project or use an existing one.
Enable the "Maps JavaScript API" and "Places API" for your project.
Generate an API key from the "APIs & Services" > "Credentials" section of your project.
Add the API Key to Your Expo Project:

If you haven't already, create a secrets.js file in your project's root directory.
Add your Google Maps API key to this file.
javascript
Copy code
// secrets.js
export const GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY';
Access the API Key in Your Code:

In your code, import the API key from secrets.js and use it when initializing the MapView.
javascript
Copy code
// HomeScreen.js
import { GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY } from '../../secrets'; // Adjust the path as needed

// ...

<MapView
  style={styles.map}
  initialRegion={initialRegion}
  provider="google"
  customMapStyle={mapStyle} // Optional: Customize map style if desired
  mapType="standard" // Choose the desired map type
  apiKey={GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY} // Use the API key from secrets.js
>
  {/* Add markers for stores on the map */}
  {/* ... (previous code) */}
</MapView>

// ...
Ensure that you've completed these steps to configure Firebase and add your Google Maps API key to your Expo project. These configurations are crucial for your app's functionality, especially for user authentication and map integration.
